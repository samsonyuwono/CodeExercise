## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

1. I would utilize SCSS. I have exposure to SCSS but didn't feel comfortable using and applying my lack of knowledge in SCSS best practices for this.

2. Added the filter for Year. I decided to focus on prioritizing the other filters in order to make it the best it possibly can. I would look into creating a slider for Year to switch things up.

3. Fix the data structure for genres when it's being added to the array.

4. Extract the fetchMedia function into a different file so I can keep things DRY and modular.

5. Extract all event listeners for the filter section and consolidate it all into one function.

6. Add an animation where the karat for the dropdown changes direction everytime it's toggled.

7. Better error handling.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

I was coming back from a vacation and didn't have the benefit of completing this at my own leisure during the weekend.
I wish I had more time to complete this. Please see the section above for what I would have done differently
