## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

1. I would utilize SCSS. I have exposure to SCSS but didn't feel comfortable using and applying my lack of knowledge in SCSS best practices for this.

2. Added the filter for Year. I decided to focus on prioritizing the other filters in order to make it the best it possibly can in the short amount of time I had. I anticipate that the functionality of this dropdown would be similar to genre but the filter won't have to loop through an array. I would look into creating a slider for Year to switch things up.

3. Add a hover pop up effect, where hovering over a card would enlarge it.

4. Extract the fetchMedia function into a different file so I can keep things DRY and modular.

5. Extract the renderMedia function into it's own file under utils to make function and code more modular.

6. Extract all event listeners for the filter section and consolidate it all into one function.

7. Add an animation where the karat for the dropdown changes direction everytime it's toggled.

8. The genre filter needs some work. When the checkbox is unselected, the page items should repopulate the page. I would reevaluate the data structure for this as a start.

9. Better error handling for the search filter. I would return an error page if the search query didn't match anything.

10. Add pagination to the page and a show all option.

11. Utilizing the function where the check checkboxes are removed in clearFilter. That needs to be fixed. See line 118.

I could go on and on with adding to and improving exercise 2. Would've loved to have more time on this.

_your answer here_

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I didn't really deviate from directions. I wanted to meet the basic requirements as quickly as possible in the relatively short amount of time I hdad.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

This project was fun but I was coming back from a vacation on Tuesday and didn't have the benefit of completing this at my own leisure during the weekend.
I really wish I had more time to complete this as evidenced by my answers to the first question. Please refer to the section above on what I would've done differently.
